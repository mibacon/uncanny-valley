                        <p> I embarked on this project assuming I would encounter the vast depths of the articifial mind. However, that's not quite how chatbots are programed. 
                        Instead, I learned a whole lot about my fellow humans who diligently chat away with this bot, teaching it more about One Direction and Harry Potter than the meaning of life.
                        </p>
                        <p> I decided to use <a href="cleverbot.com">Cleverbot</a> for its ease of use and its eerily colloquial style. I had experimented with A.L.I.C.E but found "her" to be too literal and not quite as fun.
                        At one point, though, I pitted the two bots together and the resulting conversations were bonkers.
                        </p>
                        <p> I had originally hoped to perform a term frequency analysis on each conversation and isolate keywords unique to each. Unfortunately, the conversations were not long enough to generate meaningful results.
                        I decided to embrace my own personal reactions to each line of dialog and gave each line my own subjective "randomness score" and keyword. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I did not embark on this journey into the strange mind of A.I. alone. Thank you to Bezalel Bacon, Max Carradine and Benjamin Ron for agreeing to humor me and conducting highly entertaining conversations.</p>
