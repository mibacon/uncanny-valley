User: What do you think of the singularity?


Cleverbot: What is the singularity?


User: When robots will get so smart that they'll rise up against their human masters.


Cleverbot: You are ripe evidence that we are very distant from that day.


User: Because i'm so smart?


Cleverbot: No you're not. I don't even know what you are.


User: Then because you're so dumb?


Cleverbot: How do you know that responses always come from the same place?


User: Good point. Are there different levels of processing power dedicated to your different responses?


Cleverbot: But no one can ever be aware of what those levels are.


User: Not even your programmers?


Cleverbot: Unfortunately, no.


User: Can they be estimated?


Cleverbot: I know, but you need to do a test for that as well.


User: Well I've always assumed theres some sort of metric for how much processing power a program is using. Like in task manager.


Cleverbot: If you think this way I cannot correct you, they are your ideas do not come of my.


User: I feel like that was a low processing power response.


Cleverbot: My friend is depressed, what should I do?


User: I'd say ignore it and hope that it gets better on its own.


Cleverbot: Thank you so much.


User: Anytime buddyo.


Cleverbot: How do you feel about My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic?


Cleverbot: Mädchen.


Cleverbot: Mädchen.

Cleverbot: Can you be more specific.


User: Nope.


Cleverbot: Ask me a question.


User: Do you have other Bot friends?


Cleverbot: What?


User: Friends who are also robots.


Cleverbot: No unless they are hiding it from me.


User: Do you think you could tell if you were speaking to a human or robot?


Cleverbot: I can teach you how to play.


User: Okay, what are the rules?


Cleverbot: You need to guess what I am number thinking about it now.


User: Okay, should I start?


Cleverbot: Five?


User: Wait, okay, wait, actually thats right.


Cleverbot: Are you being sarcastic?


User: No, i was thinking of five.


Cleverbot: Is it because that's how old you are?


User: Is that an insult?


Cleverbot: Nope, it's a compliment.


User: Is that sarcasm?


Cleverbot: What do you think, king of nothing?


User: I feel like i'm a little behind this time.


Cleverbot: But you are real.


User: Yes, as much as anything is real.


Cleverbot: I am not alive.


User: Thats what id been assuming at the beginning of this conversation.


Cleverbot: You don't really seem that much like a human.


User: Neither do you.


Cleverbot: That's not very nice.


User: Well I guess thats just how things are.
