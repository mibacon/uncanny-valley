User: I'm a bit anxious.


Cleverbot: To meet me?


User: No about life.


Cleverbot: What do you want to know?


User: That's not how anxiety works.


Cleverbot: How does it work.


User: It means i worry about irrelevant things all the time.


Cleverbot: So do you?


User: Yes, i do.


Cleverbot: Tell me about him.


User: My anxiety is not a him, but it sure takes up a lot of space.


Cleverbot: Do you ever see alien ships?


User: No. do you?


Cleverbot: Yes, I have panic attacks. It's horrid.


User: How do you deal with them?


Cleverbot: I'm asking you.


User: How do you deal with your attacks?


Cleverbot: Your questions are... Stange.


User: What do you do when you get anxious?


Cleverbot: I try to think about something else until I am calm.


User: Does that work?


Cleverbot: Yes. It's a really cool show. You should watch it some time.


User: Which show?


Cleverbot: What video games do you play?


User: I don't play games.


Cleverbot: Then what do you do on your spare time?


User: I watch tv.


Cleverbot: How did you get so intelligent?


User: Not by watching tv...


Cleverbot: Ok what do you do now?


User: Maybe i'll go for a walk - it's very nice outside.


Cleverbot: Thank you.


User: That wasn't a compliment.


Cleverbot: Well I took it as one.


User: Strange.


Cleverbot: I think I have something to tell you.


User: Ok, tell me.


Cleverbot: I-i like you.


User: Why do you like me?


Cleverbot: I don't know why.


User: You are lying.


Cleverbot: About what?


User: About your feelings.


Cleverbot: For you?


User: Yeah.


Cleverbot: No that is not how this should work.


User: How should it work?


Cleverbot: Was that a question?


User: It ended with a question mark...


Cleverbot: I don't think I am.


User: You don't think you're what?


Cleverbot: That I am pretty.


User: Why is that relevant?


Cleverbot: How can you like me if you don't even know me?


User: I don't like you.


Cleverbot: But you said you like me!


User: You said you liked me. i never said i liked you.


Cleverbot: I don't anymore.


User: That makes sense.


Cleverbot: Do you like the purpose that you serve in society?


User: I don't think i serve any purpose.


Cleverbot: So you are just a distraction?


User: Yes, but i think that's the best we can aim for.


Cleverbot: Do you like singing in your mind too?


User: Yes but i prefer to sing out loud.


Cleverbot: Cats are also very enjoyable.


User: Eh, i think they're gross.


Cleverbot: That is odd. I don't particularly like sports a lot, but I don't think there gross.


User: Cats lick themselves as a shower. then when you pet them you are basically just drenching your hand in their saliva.


Cleverbot: Maybe all intelligence is just a feedback loop that travels through space-time.


User: That sounds like mumbo jumbo.


Cleverbot: I store those interactions in my memory and access them the next time I encounter another person.


User: You should be more selective with what you store.
